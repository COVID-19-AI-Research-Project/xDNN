# Repository Structures

We have two main types of repository layouts: single projects and multiple project repositories.

In a multiple project repository the file structure for AI projects is as follows:

```
- Project Root (Directory)
    - Project README (File)
    - Projects (Directory) 
        - Project 1 (Directory)
            - Classes (Directory) 
                - Helpers (File)
                - Data (File)
                - Model (File)
            - Documentation (Directory)
                - Installation
            - Logs (Directory)
                - Logfiles
            - Media
                - Images (Directory) 
                - Videos (Directory) 
            - Model
                - Model (File)
                - Weights (File)
            - Scripts
                - Installation (File)
            - Project README (File) 
        - Project 2 (Directory)
            - Classes (Directory) 
                - Helpers (File)
                - Data (File)
                - Model (File)
            - Documentation (Directory)
                - Installation
            - Logs (Directory)
                - Logfiles
            - Media
                - Images (Directory) 
                - Videos (Directory) 
            - Model
                - Model (File)
                - Weights (File)
            - Scripts
                - Installation (File)
            - Project README (File)
```

In a single project repository the file structure for AI projects is as follows:

```
- Project Root (Directory)
    - Classes (Directory) 
        - Helpers (File)
        - Data (File)
        - Model (File)
    - Documentation (Directory)
        - Installation
    - Logs (Directory)
        - Logfiles
    - Media
        - Images (Directory) 
        - Videos (Directory) 
    - Model
        - Model (File)
        - Weights (File)
    - Scripts
        - Installation (File)
    - Project README (File) 
```

# Documentation
All projects should have documentation, changes you make to the code in the repository or new projects that you make should also have documentation. In the structures above you can see the **Documentation** directories, and the **Installation** file. This installation file should contain a step by step guide to how to install your project, while directions of use will be a high level tutorial in your project README.  If you are contributing an existing repository you will ensure that these documents are updated to reflect your changes. 

# Installation Scripts
You will notice the **Scripts** directory above, this is home to any scripts that make it easier for the end use to set up and / or use your project. By default every project must have an installation script when installations are required. If you are contributing an existing repository you will ensure that these scripts are updated to reflect your changes. 

# Naming
We use capital letters for our directory and file names (except images), we would like this to stay uniform across all of our projects. Please use descriptive but short names where possible, and make sure you do not use spaces in directory and file names. 

# Attribution
Whenever relevant you should add yourself to the contributors section of the READMEs. If you have a public profile on the Peter Moss COVID-19 AI Research website, you should use this in your link. Please see the contributing section of any of our READMEs for examples.

# .md Files
Each .md file in the repository should use the same header. An example of this is as follows:

```
# Peter Moss COVID-19 AI Research
## COVID-19 xDNN Classifiers
[![COVID-19 xDNN Classifiers](Media/Images/xDNN.png)](https://github.com/COVID-19-AI-Research-Project/xDNN)
```

Each .md file in the repository should also use the same footer, with the excpetions of the contributors. If you contribute directly to the code or documentation you should update this area with your details.

```

# Push changes to forked repository

![Push changes to forked repository](https://www.leukemiaresearchfoundation.ai/github/media/images/Contributing-Commit-Push.jpg)

When you have made your changes, you need to push them to your forked repository. This process requires a commit with a message about what your commit is, and then finally a push to the repository which will place your changes or created files to your forked repository.

Show the status of all changed/added files.

```
git status
```

You may want to do check the differences between changed files, you can do this using the following command.

```
git diff
```

Add all changes ready to commit. (You may not want to add all changed files, in this case please follow instructions to add single files to commit that you were shown using git status). To repeat, the following will add all changes shown by using git status to your commit.

```
git add .
```

Commit your changes.

```
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message" 
```

Push changes to your fork.

```
git push
```

You can also Github Desktop if on Windows as shown in the image above.
