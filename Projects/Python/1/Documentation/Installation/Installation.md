# Introduction
The following guide will take you through setting up and installing the  [ COVID-19 xDNN Python Classifier](https://github.com/COVID-19-AI-Research-Project/xDNN/Projects/Python " COVID-19 xDNN Python Classifier").

The xDNN Classifier is a process of predicting class or category from observed features or given data file in less time compared to the ordinary model. This is a lightweight model
and easy to consume dataspace for the training and testing features and provide necessary operation. there are many variants in the model which provide an accurate result with consuming huge
data from the server or the machine. this method provides an edge computing device freedom of evaluating the xDNN is utilizing models. Models are genuine preparing information tests
 (pictures), which are neighbourhood pinnacles of the observational information conveyance called regularity just as of the information thickness. This generative model is 
 distinguished in a shut structure and likens to the pdf yet is gotten consequently and altogether from the preparation information with no client or issue explicit edges, 
 boundaries or intercession. The proposed xDNN offers another profound learning design that consolidates thinking and learning in cooperative energy. 
 It is non-iterative and non-parametric, which clarifies its productivity regarding time and computational assets.

# Required Hardware

Basic Computer Configuration:

1. Processor    - Intel i3 or above 
2. Ram          - 4 GB and above
3. Harddisk     - 10 GB space
4. Graphics Card - NVIDIA GTX1050

&nbsp;

# Prerequisites 

The required operating system can be Windows, Linux or MacOS. 

The software required are as follows:
1. [Anaconda IDE](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
2. [Tensorflow Library](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)
3. [PyTorch Libary](https://pytorch.org/) (Optional)
4. [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
 

&nbsp;

# Installation 

First install the Anaconda IDE and navigate to the command prompt. 
Create a new environment for Python 3.6 as by default the anaconda has python 3.7 installed. 
```
conda create -n myenv python=3.6
```

Go to the root directory of this project file and install the dependencies using the following command in the prompt. 
```
pip -r requirements.txt
```
It will ask rights for installing the libaries. Just type Y and enter when asked. This will take some time to install the dependencies as it may consume more data depending on the file. 

After completing the process. Restart the computer and open Anaconda Navigator and click on the spyder IDE.
