# Prerequisites

## MATLAB Software R2020a
It is mandatory to download the copy of [MATLAB](https://in.mathworks.com/) or the MATLAB installer onto your system after you fill out the required information to get it. Some users choose to receive a DVD in the mail instead of downloading the product online. No matter which technique you use, you eventually get a copy of MATLAB to install.

In most cases, you need to download the copy of MATLAB or the MATLAB installer onto your system after you fill out the required information to get it. Some users choose to receive a DVD in the mail instead of downloading the product online. No matter which technique you use, you eventually get a copy of MATLAB to install.

## Python3
Download the [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) as MATLAB 2020 will support releases upto Python 3.7 for calling MATLAB functions through MATLAB engine from python scripts.

After downloading the package, follow the below Environment Setup and add the PATH for the given Python Version.

## Clone the Repository

Clone the [COVID-19 xDNN](https://github.com/COVID-19-AI-Research-Project/xDNN " COVID-19 xDNN") repository from the [Peter Moss COVID-19 AI Research](https://github.com/COVID-19-AI-Research-Project "Peter Moss COVID-19 AI Research") Github Organization.

<<<<<<< HEAD
To clone the repository and install the COVID-19 Tensorflow DenseNet Classifier, make sure you have Git installed. Now navigate to the home directory on your device using terminal/commandline, and then use the following command.

To clone the repository and install this project, make sure you have Git installed. Now navigate to the home directory on your device using terminal/commandline, and then use the following command.
>>>>>>> 8e197950a416502c0a06c42add58a3296f4745c5

```
  $ git clone https://github.com/COVID-19-AI-Research-Project/xDNN.git
```

Once you have used the command above you will see a directory called **xDNN** in your home directory.

```
ls
```

Using the ls command in your home directory should show you the following.

```

Navigate to **COVID-19-AI-Research-Project/Projects/Matlab/1** directory, this is your project root directory for this tutorial.

### Developer Forks

=======
XDNN
```

Navigate to **COVID-19-AI-Research-Project/XDNN/Projects/Matlab/1** directory, this is your project root directory for this tutorial.

### Developer Forks
>>>>>>> 8e197950a416502c0a06c42add58a3296f4745c5
Developers from the Github community that would like to contribute to the development of this project should first create a fork, and clone that repository. For detailed information please view the [CONTRIBUTING](../../../../../CONTRIBUTING.md "CONTRIBUTING") guide. You should pull the latest code from the development branch.

```
  $ git clone -b "0.2.0" https://github.com/COVID-19-AI-Research-Project/xDNN.git
```

The **-b "0.2.0"** parameter ensures you get the code from the latest master branch. Before using the below command please check our latest master branch in the button at the top of the project README.
